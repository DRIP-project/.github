## DRiP: Doing Research in Public

We have been toying with ideas about writing papers the way open-source code is written. Take a look at [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_research-opensource-openscience-activity-6843530675270877184-L1un/), especially the discussion in the comments for some good background into these discussions. 

The idea of GitHub for science/academic research has been proposed before (see e.g. [vonMuhlen2011](https://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science.html) and [Banks2017](https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/we-need-a-github-for-academic-research.html)) but there the focus was on the value of sharing the output of scientifc research in an open way. Our focus is on the _process_ of collaboration that is enabled by GitHub and collaborative software development best practices. This is what we want to adapt to scientific research. 

To some extent, this can be thought of as applying agile methodologies to the research process. But since research is already super agile, the methodologies would work in the reverse direction, making research more structured (necessary for this kind of collaboration). Some early thoughts on this can be found [in this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_quantumcomputing-agile-scrum-activity-6745019811497070593-cDp5). 

Why do we want to do this? We believe that there is untapped potential in the gap between professional science and citizen science---we refer to this gap as _densizen science_. To tap into this potential, we need a framework that allows professional scientists, ex-scientists, independent researchers, up-and-coming talent without access to mentorship, (and others...), a framework for effective scientific collaboration, that does not rely on pre-established scientific networks, where each person can contribute according to their abilities. This is what is enabled by the _process_ of collaborative software development, as practiced in the open source software community.
